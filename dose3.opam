synopsis: "Dose library (part of Mancoosi tools)"
description: """
The dose suite provides libraries for handling package meta-data, and various
 tools for analyzing package relationships in a large package repository.
  - dose-builddebcheck checks, given a collection of source package stanzas
    and a collection of binary package stanzas of Debian packages, whether
    the build-dependencies of each source package can be satisfied by the
    binary packages.
  - dose-distcheck checks for every package of a distribution whether it
    is possible to satisfy its dependencies and conflicts within this
    distribution.
  - ceve, a general metadata parser supporting different input formats
    (Debian, rpm, and others) and different output formats.
  - dose-outdated, a Debian-specific tool for finding packages that are not
    installable with respect to a package repository, and that can only be
    made installable again by fixing the package itself.
  - dose-challenged, a Debian-specific tool for checking which packages
    will certainly become uninstallable when some existing package is upgraded
    to a newer version.
  - dose-deb-coinstall, a Debian-specific tool for checking whether a set of
    packages can be installed all together."""
